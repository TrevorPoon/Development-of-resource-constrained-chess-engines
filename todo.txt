Implement baseline reinforcement learning models such as DQN, PPO, and A2C to serve as reference points for computational performance and chess-playing strength.
Develop the methodology by detailing the design of a lightweight AlphaZero-inspired agent that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for policy estimation with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to navigate the large chess action space.
Plans in the methodology to research and adapt reinforcement learning techniques from other domains like Go and Atari, aiming to improve speed and memory efficiency without sacrificing playing ability.
